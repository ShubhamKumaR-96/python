print('''Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star
Up above the world so far,
Shining bright with every light,
Guiding travelers through the night.

Sparkling in the midnight sky,
Winking down from way up high,
Twinkle, twinkle, softly glow,
In the heavens, row by row.

Though you're distant, far from here,
Your gentle light feels ever near,
Twinkle, twinkle, little spark,
Lighting dreams within the dark.
